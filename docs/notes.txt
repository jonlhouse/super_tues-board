Rules:
  There should be default rules that are in place when the game starts.
  These rules should be mutable either permanently or for a fixed duration.
  Cards, News and Bills can all change rules.

  Rules will implemented as OpenStructs so I can define them via a yaml or
  JSON structure but access them via method calls.
  This will also let me define methods if needed.

  There will be a default_rules defined in SuperTues::Game.default_rules.  Each 
  game can have a rule_change definition that overlays on the default rules.
